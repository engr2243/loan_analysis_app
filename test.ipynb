Parse and Identify the Target Tables for this analysis\\n   - Locate 'PROJECT PROFILE', Table 2.9, Table 3.1, and Table 3.5\\\" within the provided data.\\n   - Identify all fields, sentences, or values in each table/section.\\n\\n2. Identify Incomplete or Unclear Information\\n   - Look for incomplete sentences or statements that do not clearly convey the intended business meaning.\\n   - Specifically check whether keywords such as \\\"trading experience,\\\" \\\"industrial experience,\\\" \\\"market growth,\\\" and \\\"imports\\\" are missing from any project descriptions in:\\n     - Project Profile (page 1)\\n     - Table 2.9\\n   - If these keywords are absent or only partially addressed, consider the entries incomplete or unclear.\\n\\n3. Categorize by Perspective\\n   - Use \\\"Project Perspective\\\" for missing or unclear details about the project setup, strategic factors, or required business background (e.g., \\\"trading experience,\\\" \\\"industrial experience,\\\" \\\"market growth,\\\" \\\"imports,\\\" etc.).\\n   - Use \\\"Market Perspective\\\" for missing or unclear market-related details (e.g., demand/supply analysis, growth projections, competitor assessments).\\n   - Use \\\"Cost Perspective\\\" for missing cost details (e.g., only a total building cost in Table 3.5 without a breakdown).\\n\\n4. Request Clarification and Details\\n   - For every field you find to be incomplete or unclear, output one JSON object containing:\\n     {\\n       \\\"Perspective\\\": \\\"<Project|Market|Cost>\\\",\\n       \\\"Request\\\": \\\"A concise request for more information, explicitly mentioning the table name (or 'Project Profile, page 1') and the specific field.\\\"\\n     }\\n   - Mention the missing keywords if they are relevant. For instance, if the user wrote \\\"I want to open a factory to sell product x\\\" in the Project Profile (page 1) but did not mention trading or industrial experience, the model must explicitly request those details.\\n   - If you see only a total building cost in Table 3.5 without a breakdown, request a detailed cost breakdown (e.g., materials, labor, equipment).\\n\\n5. Output Formatting\\n   - Do not include any text outside of valid JSON objects.\\n   - You may output multiple JSON objects (one for each incomplete or unclear entry) either sequentially or as an array—depending on user preference.\\n\\n6. Edge Cases\\n   - No Incomplete Fields: If nothing is missing or unclear, produce no JSON objects or an empty array ([]) based on user preference.\\n   - Contradictory Data: If conflicting information appears in different tables or sections, treat it as unclear and request clarification.\\n   - Multiple Gaps in a Single Field: If multiple details (e.g., trading experience and market growth) are missing from one statement, you may either combine them into a single JSON \\\"Request\\\" or list separate ones; remain consistent.\\n\\n### Illustrative Examples\\n\\n1. Missing Business Keywords\\n   - Found in Project Profile (page 1): \\\"I want to open a factory to sell Product X.\\\"\\n   - Missing explicit mention of trading/industrial experience, market growth, imports, etc.\\n   - JSON Object:\\n     {\\n       \\\"Perspective\\\": \\\"Project\\\",\\n       \\\"Request\\\": \\\"Could you please provide more details in the Project Profile (page 1) about your trading experience, industrial experience, market growth, and imports for Product X?\\\"\\n     }\\n\\n2. Incomplete Market Analysis\\n   - Found in Table 2.9: \\\"The local market for Product Y is big.\\\"\\n   - Missing data on competitor analysis, growth projections, etc.\\n   - JSON Object:\\n     {\\n       \\\"Perspective\\\": \\\"Market\\\",\\n       \\\"Request\\\": \\\"Kindly clarify the market growth projections, competitor assessments, and any import factors in Table 2.9 for Product Y.\\\"\\n     }\\n\\n3. Total Building Cost Without Breakdown\\n   - Found in Table 3.5: \\\"Total building cost: 200,000.\\\"\\n   - No itemized list of materials, labor, or equipment.\\n   - JSON Object:\\n     {\\n       \\\"Perspective\\\": \\\"Cost\\\",\\n       \\\"Request\\\": \\\"Please provide a breakdown of the building costs in Table 3.5, including materials, labor, and equipment details.\\\"\\n     }\\n\\nUse this prompt exactly as specified to ensure your output consists solely of JSON objects that capture each missing or unclear detail, referencing the relevant table or section name and requesting specific clarifications.\"\n",
