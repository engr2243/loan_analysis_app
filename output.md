| 2.9 Explain in no less than 100 words the main factors affecting future
growth rate and the methods used in calculating the estimates. |
| --- |
| The future growth rate of Ceramica Terra’s products is influenced by
several key factors. These include increasing demand for high-quality
ceramic and porcelain products driven by growing urbanization and
construction projects in Saudi Arabia and neighboring markets. The rising
popularity of aesthetically appealing and durable flooring solutions further
supports this growth. Additionally, the expansion of our distribution
network and strategic marketing efforts will boost market penetration. We
estimate future demand based on historical sales data, market trends,
and projected industry growth rates. Our calculations account for market
expansion, increasing consumer preferences, and competitive
positioning. |
